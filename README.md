### Features

- Creation of frontend storefront and administrator interface

- Endpoints protected for admin/regular users with json web tokens

### Using the Site
    
The administrator interface is protected by Auth0 login, to view login with the details {username: 'Finn@email.test', password : 'password'}

### Next Steps

If we were to continue the development of this project, one area we could focus on would be creating the infrastructure to host multiple stores on our platform.         Another area could be adding a recommender system to our platform to increase engagement and generate value for our clients.
